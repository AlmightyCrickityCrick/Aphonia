    "\"They say the sky caught fire that night. {w}But what really died… was silence.\""

    "The year was 2084. {w}For decades, humanity danced on the edge of its own hubris—satellites blanketing the sky, cities pulsing with artificial life, ozone stretched thin like skin over a burning sun."

    "And then came Helios."

    "It wasn’t just a solar storm. {w}It was the storm—a wave of stellar rage, the most powerful in recorded history. {w}One night was all it took."
    "The ozone collapsed. {w}The surface boiled. {w}Asphalt turned to glass. {w}Steel curled like paper."
    "Cities—vast and shining—crumbled into craters of ash and melted wire. {w}Survivors didn’t run. {w}There was nowhere to run."

    "They burrowed instead—deep into the earth."

    "Thus was born Arca."

    "A subterranean refuge. {w}A network of interconnected megastructures designed for science, survival, and silence. {w}It was meant to be humanity’s second chance."
    "But fifteen years later, something else awoke within those corridors—something not born of sun or war. {w}They called it Aphony."

    scene darkness with Dissolve(3.0)

    "It began as a whisper. {w}A subtle resonance in the walls. {w}At first, the engineers thought it was structural fatigue." 
    "Then the voices started—fragments of words, static laughter in the ventilation, the sound of footsteps behind closed doors. {w}Entire districts fell into madness."

    "No enemy to shoot. No gas to clear. Just sound. Or the absence of it."

    "Aphony grew—not like a virus, but like an echo. A field of invisible distortion, resonating through the metal bones of Arca. Some heard music. Others, screams. Some simply vanished." 
    "But all who stayed long enough felt it: the crumbling of the mind. The silence that wasn’t empty. The noise that didn’t belong."
