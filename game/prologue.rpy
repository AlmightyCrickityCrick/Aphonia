    "\"They say the sky caught fire that night. {w}But what really died… was silence.\""

    "The year was 2084. {w}For decades, humanity danced on the edge of its own hubris—satellites blanketing the sky, cities pulsing with artificial life, ozone stretched thin like skin over a burning sun."

    "And then came Helios."

    "It wasn’t just a solar storm. {w}It was the storm—a wave of stellar rage, the most powerful in recorded history. {w}One night was all it took."
    "The ozone collapsed. {w}The surface boiled. {w}Asphalt turned to glass. {w}Steel curled like paper."
    "Cities—vast and shining—crumbled into craters of ash and melted wire. {w}Survivors didn’t run. {w}There was nowhere to run."

    "They burrowed instead—deep into the earth."

    "Thus was born Arca."

    "A subterranean refuge. {w}A network of interconnected megastructures designed for science, survival, and silence. {w}It was meant to be humanity’s second chance."
    "But fifteen years later, something else awoke within those corridors—something not born of sun or war. {w}They called it Aphony."

    "It began as a whisper. {w}A subtle resonance in the walls. {w}At first, the engineers thought it was structural fatigue." 
    "Then the voices started—fragments of words, static laughter in the ventilation, the sound of footsteps behind closed doors. {w}Entire districts fell into madness."

    "No enemy to shoot. {w}No gas to clear. {w}Just sound. {w}Or the absence of it."

    "Aphony grew—not like a virus, but like an echo. {w}A field of invisible distortion, resonating through the metal bones of Arca. {w}Some heard music. {w}Others, screams. {w}Some simply vanished." 
    "But all who stayed long enough felt it: the crumbling of the mind. {w}The silence that wasn’t empty. {w}The noise that didn’t belong."

    "People were trapped in their sectors when it began."

    "Automated lockdowns sealed families apart. {w}Parents clawed at steel doors while their children cried behind unbreakable steel. {w}Some wrote messages on walls with trembling hands:"
    "\"It’s not my voice.\" {w}\"I heard her again.\" {w}\"They’re inside now.\""

    "And the worst part? {w}There was no way out. {w}Only deeper in."

    "Among those still breathing, a task force was formed—not soldiers, not heroes, just those who hadn’t yet broken. {w}Their job: investigate, contain, and cleanse the infected zones. {w}Sector by sector."
    "Day by day. {w}Until the sound stopped—or until they did."
