    scene room with Dissolve(2.0)

    "Twilight had crept into the base before dawn. {w}Not that anyone really noticed the difference: the vents’ lamps had been flickering for hours, the power was unstable, and the clock on the wall was frozen at 4:17 again."
    "Somewhere near the ceiling, the wiring crackled — a nervous tic of the metal beast hiding behind the walls. {w}The air was thick, laced with dust and... something acidic."

    "In the makeshift kitchen, Darin was fiddling with a burner, wiping sweat from his forehead. {w}Something was bubbling in a tin can — too loudly for soup."

    darin "This... is either soup or corrosive acid. {w}Fifty-fifty. {w}Wanna gamble, Kael?"

    "At the far table, hunched over a disassembled pulse rifle, Kael didn’t even look up."

    kael "If it melts your tongue, we finally get some peace and quiet. {w}Do it."
